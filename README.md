**INTRODUCTION**

This is the report of the coursework designed to produce a system or an application that handles library management system. The program was developed with the precise aid of algorithms and pseudocodes accompanied by the flowcharts. 
As the tasks assigned were not so easy. In order to describe our ability to understand and face the questions as well as demonstrate them in an illustrative  way as per the requirement requires a lot of firmness. So, perceiving the challenges to complete the tasks in the given period of time and make it beneficial to the targeted audience, the entire efforts are devoted till the final outlook of report is drawn.  
This coursework i.e. library management system is similar to the inventory system which will help the user to borrow and return the books available in the library. The library is a place where the user can borrow and return the book with his/her desire. The library lets its users to choose any of the available book to borrow. Well, you may ask why we need to develop this system when there is no need of it. Because the libraries of today are coping well with their old methods i.e. recording the user borrowed or returned history in the paper rather than in software. Even without the help of today’s modern software the libraries are managing and are not facing any problems. Yes, it is true but we should always see for the future progress. Because there is technological advances in every sector in today’s world.  
With the new technologies and system being brought up to life the old methods or techniques should start to change with the passage of time. There is a need for developing this system because our libraries are slowly changing into modern ones and they need the newly developed software. This software or program will help the libraries to keep the proper track of the books borrowed and returned by the user and will help them to ensure there are no loss of books.
